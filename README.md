Adds a link to the post to sort an AskMeFi by favorites. This can be useful for questions with many answers that do not refer to each other.

Installation: drag'n'drop mefi-favsort.js to your Chrome Extensions page

Usage: when the userscript is loaded, click on the link
"sort by favorites". Only works on ask.metafilter.com.

Written as a script for Chrome, but should work in Greasemonkey for Firefox as well.
